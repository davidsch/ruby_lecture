# Blocks #
* In the beginning they were designed to abstract loop iterations
* Blocks are basically nameless functions
* Code passed as argument to methods

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Blocks #
* Can be executed
* Can take parameters
* Can be invoked by the function it is an argument to
* Preserve the binding to the context where they were created

# Blocks #
* Blocks can be transformed to closures which are called Procs
* Procs are similar to lambdas
   anonymous, callable, support for currying
* Procs can be converted to blocks


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Blocks also #
* Are objects
* Can be instantiated from their class
