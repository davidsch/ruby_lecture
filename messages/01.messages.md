# Message sending and lookup #


!SLIDE
## Messages are sent to a receiver ##


!SLIDE code
    @@@ ruby
    receiver.message(*arguments)

    # is the same as

    receiver.send('message', *arguments)


!SLIDE
## The receiver can be implicit ##


!SLIDE code
    @@@ ruby
    message(*arguments)

    # is the same as

    self.message(*arguments)

<!-- Explain what self is in this context -->


!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Method lookup #

* lookup the method in the class of the receiver
* lookup the method in the ancestors of the class
* If the method is found call it
* If the method is not found send "method_missing" to the receiver


!SLIDE
# Example #
## Method Missing ##


!SLIDE code
## Python style attributes ##
    @@@ ruby
