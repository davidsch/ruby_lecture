# How does this work? #

* This works through invisible classes
* These objects are called singleton class
* Mostly invisible in the language

# Singleton Classes #
* Every object has exactly one
* Every singleton class is associated to exactly one object
* It sits between the object and its class
* allows to attach functionality to a single object
* Are generated lazily

# Singleton Classes (2) #
* If classes are Objects
* And classes are instances of object
* how are class methods defined?

# Example (2) #

# Singleton Classes (3)
* classes also have singleton classes
* classes are instances of the class Class
* class methods are defined on the singleton class of the class
* but what about the singleton classes of singleton classes?
